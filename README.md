# Folder Taskbar

Lists the folder windows that are running in Explorer and activates the selected folder.

Use it as an adjunct to the Windows 11 taskbar.

# Install

1. Download the appropriate file for your environment from [Releases](https://github.com/3xKEsGJQsmEQLAfuMv9QikF8i9y7Bf1D6NjguXg/folder-taskbar/releases).
  - For .NET Framework 4.8
    - `FolderTaskbar_NetFW48_x.x.x.x.zip`
  - For .NET 6
    - `FolderTaskbar_NET60_x.x.x.x.zip`
2. Right-click on the zip, select Properties, check `UnBlock` and close with the OK button.
3. Extract the zip and place it in the desired location.
4. Launch `FolderTaskbar.exe`.

# Uninstall

Delete the entire extracted folder.

# Usage

As many buttons as there are Explorer windows will be displayed.
Pressing a button activates the corresponding window.

Press the `üåÄ` button to reflect the latest status. It will not be reflected automatically.

Press the `‚ùå` button to exit the program.

If you move the mouse cursor close to the `<-->` in the lower left corner, this window will move to another location.

# Supplement

You can also use it on Windows 10, but it is more comfortable to set the taskbar as follows than to use this app.

| Taskbar location on screen | `Left` or `Right`                 |
